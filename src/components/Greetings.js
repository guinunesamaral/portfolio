              My name is Guilherme Nunes, I'm 19, I live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil,
              and I am a junior developer. I created this page to share my
              projects and to let people contact me, because I'm looking for
              work opportunities. I really like to learn new technologies and
              most of the time I code with React.js, Java and TypeScript. Feel
              free to contact me and to follow in my other medias as well.
